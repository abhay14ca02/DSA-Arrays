package com.arrays.easy.CountElementsWithMaximumFrequency;

//You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
//Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.
//The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
//Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4] ,Output: 4
//Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
//So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
//Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], Output: 5
//Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
//So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
